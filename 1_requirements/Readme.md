#Introduction
It is a simple calculator project. In  some of calculators we can add, subtract, multiply, divide the numbers. In this project we can find Factorial of the number, Powers of the numbers. In this project there is no any GUI(graphical user interface). It is works on command prompt.

#Research 
For this project, I researched about the simple calculator projects. In lots of projects they used simple switch case and if conditions. But in this project, I used different concepts like pointer functions, enum , typedef, functions, etc.

#Cost and Features
In some of the calculators we cannot find the factorial of a number. In this project we can find factorial of a number. There is no any compare between available calculators.

#4W's and 1H

#Who:
This software useful to primary school standards students.

#What:
This product enable to find out factorial, powers of a number, etc.'

#When:
The product going to used when they need to calculate like factorial, powers of a number, modulus, etc.

#Where:
This project can be implement in primary schools.

#How:
This project works in command prompt. so, user need to have computer or laptop to run this project and to use the functions to get the results.
