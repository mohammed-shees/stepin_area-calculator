#Requirements

#Introduction It is a simple area calculator project. In this calculators we can find the area of different shapes. In this project we can also find the area of complicated shapes like trapezium and parallelogram. In this project there is no any GUI(graphical user interface). It is works on command prompt.

#Research For this project, I researched about the simple calculator projects. In lots of projects they used simple switch case and if conditions. But in this project, I used different concepts like pointer functions, enum , typedef, functions, etc.

#Cost and Features In some of the calculators we cannot find the area directly of any shape for that w ehave to use the formula but using this calculator it saves time and makes the process more efficient. 

#defining Our System

#Strength
able to find the areas of complicated figures 

#weakness
there is no gui 

#opportunities 
Need to improve features to get opportunity.

#Threats
hardware failure.
Strong competition from otehr calculator.

#4W's and 1H

#Who: This software useful to primary school standards students.

#What: This product enables us to find out areas of simple and complicated shapes.

#When: The product is going to be used when they need to calculate the area of lands, roads or even during construction.

#Where: This project can be implement in primary schools.

#How: This project works in command prompt. so, user need to have computer or laptop to run this project and to use the functions to get the results.
