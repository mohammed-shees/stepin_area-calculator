#Requirements

#Introduction
this is a an areaa calculator project. In  some of calculators we can do just the basic arithematic operations but in this we can find the area of basic shapes such as square, rectangle,circle,triangle,parallelogram,trapezium. In this project there is no any GUI(graphical user interface). It is works on command prompt.

#Research 
For this project, I researched about the simple calculator projects. In lots of projects they used simple switch case and if conditions. But in this project, I used different concepts like pointer functions, enum , typedef, functions, etc.

#Cost and Features
In some of the calculators we cannot find the area directly and thats puts up a challenge because some might forget the formula to find the area or even make some error which might lead to a large scale loss.

#4W's and 1H

#Who:
This software can useful to primary school standards students and also for construaction industries.

#What:
This product enables us to find the area of different shapes.

#When:
The product going to be used when they need to calculate different land masses or even large areas thats requires precise calculation.

#Where:
This project can be implement in primary schools and large industries.

#How:
This project works in command prompt. so, user need to have computer or laptop to run this project and to use the functions to get the results.
